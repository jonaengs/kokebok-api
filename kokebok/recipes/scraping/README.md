This module contains code for scraping recipe data from urls. The code builds on the `recipe-scrapers` library, and everything it supports should (at least in theory) also be supported by this package. The module also contains some custom scrapers that build upon the recipe-scrapers library (hence the multiple inheritance) to provide even better support. Mainly what they do is provide better ingredient groups, as the `recipe-scrapers` support for these is quite limited.
